ADMIN E-COMMERCE WEB APPLICATION

Description:
Developed a Full Stack E-commerce Website utilizing modern technologies including React JS, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Express JS, Node JS, and Stripe for seamless online transactions.

Built a comprehensive Admin Dashboard to empower administrators to manage products (add, update, or delete), monitor inventory, and oversee orders efficiently.

Developed the Backend API using Node.js and Express, with all product, user, and order data stored in a MongoDB database for scalability and performance.

Deployed the Frontend on Netlify and the Backend on Render, ensuring a fully functional and accessible e-commerce platform for end-users.

This project demonstrates my ability to deliver end-to-end web solutions, from frontend design to backend development and deployment, while prioritizing user experience and scalability.
